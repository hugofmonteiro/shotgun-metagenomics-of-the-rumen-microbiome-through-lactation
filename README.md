# Canada Study of the Rumen Microbiome

In construction...

# Bioinformatic analyses

- Deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing performed in a subset from 220 cows
- 72 dairy cows sampled for the rumen microbiome at days:
  - Day -21 relative to calving
  - Day 23 relative to calving
  - Day 65 relative to calving
- Quality check: average 50 million reads per sample detected with `fastqc`
- Trimming: Illumina universal adapters removed with `trimmomatic`
- Contamination: Host reads were removed from samples with `kraken`
- Taxonomy assignment: to be performed in `sourmash`
